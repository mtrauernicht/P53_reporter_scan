## Introduction

It is unclear how TP53 binding site architecture relates to TF activity. To test this systematically, a library was designed in collaboration with the Bussemaker lab. Design features of TP53 reporters like binding site copy number, spacer length, or core promoter choice are reviewed.

The designed first library contains:
- 6,000 TF reporters, each with up to 4 TF binding sites, followed by a minP or minCMV and a barcode in the transcription unit
- 5 different TP53 motifs with different predicted binding affinities
- Large range of combinatorial binding affinity
- Spacer length between binding sites varied from 4-14 bp in 1 bp steps
- two different core promoters
- three different synthetic inactive spacer sequences
- 5 barcodes per TF reporter

All TF reporters were designed using FIMO. This way, the spacings were designed to be inactive, while the TF binding sites were ensured to be intact.

### Experimental setup

- Nucleofection into TP53-proficient MCF7 cells and TP53-KO MCF7 cells
- TP53 Stimulation with Nutlin-3a or vehicle control (DMSO)
- RNA isolation after 24h, followed by barcode-specific reverse transcription and sequencing library prep
- experiments performed in independent triplicates

### Activity quantification

- reporter activity = cDNA counts / pDNA counts
- take average across the 5 barcodes
- then take average across the 3 biological replicates
- calculate enrichment per condition tested over background reporter activity (core promoter-only reporters)
