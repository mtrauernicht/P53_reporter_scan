# deep_scan_trp53_gr


**Introduction:**\
It is unclear how TF affinity relates to TF activity. To test this systematically for Trp53 and Gr, a library was designed in collaboration with the Bussemaker lab. 

**TF reporter library design:**\
The designed first library contains:
- ~12,000 TF reporters, each with 4 identical TF binding sites, followed by a minP or minCMV and a barcode in the transcription unit
- Trp53 or Gr motifs
- Motifs with different predicted (SELEX-seq) binding affinities
- Large range of combinatorial binding affinity
- Motif spacings of 1-10 bp
- 5 barcodes per TF reporter

All TF reporters were designed using FIMO. This way, the spacings were designed to be inactive, while the TF binding sites were ensured to be active.

**Experimental setup:**\
